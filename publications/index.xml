      <title>From Empty Pews to Empty Cradles: Fertility Decline Among European Catholics</title>
      <link>https://gragusa.org/publications/empypub/</link>

      <description>Catholic countries of Europe pose a demographic puzzle –fertility is unprecedentedly low (total fertility$=$1.3$) despite low female labor force participation. We model three channels of religious effects on demand for children: through changing norms, reduced market wages, and reduced costs of childrearing. We estimate their effects using new panel data on church attendance and clergy employment for thirteen European countries from 1960-2000, spanning the Second Vatican Council (1962-65). Catholic theology is uniform across countries.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Estimation of State Space Models Using Moment Conditions</title>
      <link>https://gragusa.org/publications/bayesian-state-space/</link>

      <description>We consider Bayesian estimation of state space models when the measurement density is not available but estimating equations for the parameters of the measurement density are available from moment conditions. The most common applications are partial equilibrium models involving moment conditions that depend on dynamic latent variables (e.g., timevarying parameters, stochastic volatility) and dynamic general equilibrium models when moment equations from the first order conditions are available but computing an accurate approximation to the measurement density is difficult.</description>

      <title>Anchoring the Yield Curve Using Survey Expectations</title>

      <description>The dynamic behavior of the term structure of interest rates is difficult to replicate with mod- els, and even models with a proven track record of empirical performance have underperformed since the early 2000s. On the other hand, survey expectations can accurately predict yields, but they are typically not available for all maturities and/or forecast horizons. We show how survey expectations can be exploited to improve the accuracy of yield curve forecasts given by a base model.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity, Moment Conditions, and the Risk-free Rate in Yogo (2006)</title>
      <link>https://gragusa.org/publications/moment-conditions-sensitivity/</link>

      <description>In this paper we show that results presented in the seminal paper by Yogo, A Consumption Based Explanation of Expected Stock Returns, cannot be replicated. We find different estimates for the parameters and we obtain values of over-identified statistics that being much larger than those in the original paper indicate rejection of the durable consumption asset pricing model. By careful inspection of Yogo’s replication files, we were able to track down the inconsistency to a coding bug.</description>

      <title>Existence and Characterization of Conditional Density Projections</title>
      <link>https://gragusa.org/publications/density-projection/</link>

      <guid>https://gragusa.org/publications/density-projection/</guid>
      <description>In this paper we propose primitive conditions under which a projection of a conditional density onto a set defined by conditional moment restrictions exists and is unique. Moreover, we provide an analytic expression of the obtained projection. The range of applications where conditional density projections are used is wide. The derived results are potentially useful in a variety of areas including: semiparametric efficient estimation and optimal testing in (conditional) moment models, Bayesian prior determination and inference in semiparametric models, density forecasting, and simulation-based econometric analysis.</description>

      <title>Unconditional and Conditional Wage Polarization in Europe</title>
      <link>https://gragusa.org/publications/cond-uncond-polarization/</link>

      <description>This paper investigates the dynamics of the distribution of unconditional and conditional -on technology—wages in Europe, using both industry and individual level data for the period 1995-2007. We find that the unconditional wage distribution shows scant signs of polariza- tion in Europe. On the other hand, the effect of technology is more nuanced. At the industry level, technological changes have an effect on polarization of jobs, but not on polarization of wages.</description>

      <title>Generalized Method of Moments with latent variables</title>
      <link>https://gragusa.org/publications/gmm-with-latent/</link>

      <description>The contribution of generalized method of moments (Hansen and Singleton, 1982) was to allow frequentist inference regarding the parameters of a nonlinear structural model without having to solve the model. Provided there were no latent variables. The contribution of this paper is the same. With latent variables.</description>

      <title>Theory-coherent forecasting</title>

      <description>We consider a method for producing multivariate density forecasts that satisfy moment restrictions implied by economic theory, such as Euler conditions. The method starts from a base forecast that might not satisfy the theoretical restrictions and forces it to satisfy the moment conditions using exponential tilting. Although exponential tilting has been considered before in a Bayesian context (Robertson et al. 2005), our main contributions are: (1) to adapt the method to a classical inferential context with out-of-sample evaluation objectives and parameter estimation uncertainty; and (2) to formally discuss the conditions under which the method delivers improvements in forecast accuracy.</description>

      <title>Unexplored Dimensions of Discrimination in Europe: Homosexuality and Physical Appearance</title>
      <link>https://gragusa.org/publications/unexplored-discrimination-jpop/</link>

      <description>We study labor-market discrimination of individuals with &amp;ldquo;specific&amp;ldquo; characteristics in Italy. We conduct a field experiment in two Italian cities: Rome and Milan, by sending &amp;ldquo;fake&amp;ldquo; CVs to real ads. We find that there is a strong penalty for homosexuals, i.e., about 30% less chance to be called back compared to a heterosexual male and even more so if they are highly skilled. On the other hand, we find no penalty for homosexual females.</description>

      <title>Spillovers from high-skill consumption to low-skill labor markets</title>
      <link>https://gragusa.org/publications/high-skills-low-skills-spillovers/</link>

      <guid>https://gragusa.org/publications/high-skills-low-skills-spillovers/</guid>
      <description>Census data show that since 1980 low-skill workers in the United States have been increasingly employed in the provision of non-tradeable time-intensive services – such as food preparation and cleaning – that can be broadly thought as substitutes of home production activities. Meanwhile the wage gap between this sector and the rest of the economy has shrunk. If skilled workers, with their high opportunity cost of time, demand more of these time-intensive services, then wage gains at the top of the wage distribution (such as those observed in the last three decades) are expected to raise the consumption of these services, consistent with these stylized facts.</description>

      <title>Time limits: The effects on welfare use and other consumption-smoothing mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://gragusa.org/publications/time-limits/</link>

      <description>We use data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation covering the period 1989- 2006 to investigate the impact that time limits on receipt of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families have on female-headed family outcomes, including welfare use, employment and living arrangements. The effects of time limits depend on the stock of remaining months of eligibility, which in turn depends on the state time limit and on family’s welfare use since the policy was implemented.</description>

      <title>Minimum divergence, generalized empirical likelihoods, and higher order expansions</title>
      <link>https://gragusa.org/publications/mdgel/</link>

      <guid>https://gragusa.org/publications/mdgel/</guid>
      <description>This paper studies the Minimum Divergence (MD) class of estimators for econometric models specified through moment restrictions. We show that MD estimators can be obtained as solutions to a computationally tractable optimization problem. This problem is similar to the one solved by the Generalized Empirical Likelihood estimators of Newey and Smith (2004), but it is equivalent to it only for a subclass of divergences. The MD framework provides a coherent testing theory: tests for overidentification and parametric restrictions in this framework can be interpreted as semiparametric versions of Pearson-type goodness of fit tests.</description>

      <title>Bayesian likelihoods for moment condition models</title>
      <link>https://gragusa.org/publications/bayesian-moment-condition/</link>

      <guid>https://gragusa.org/publications/bayesian-moment-condition/</guid>
      <description>Bayesian inference in moment condition models is difficult to implement. For these models, a posterior distribution cannot be calculated because the likelihood function has not been fully specified. In this paper, we obtain a class of likelihoods by formal Bayesian calculations that take into account the semiparametric nature of the problem. The likelihoods are derived by integrating out the nuisance parameters with respect to a maximum entropy tilted prior on the space of distribution.</description>
