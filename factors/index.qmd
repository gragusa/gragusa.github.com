{{< ai open-data >}} This page contains the monetary policy factors constructed using the procedure in [Altavilla, Brugnolini, GÃ¼rkaynak, Motto, and Ragusa (2019) (ABGMR)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoneco.2019.08.016).

The factors are extracted from the [Euro Area Monetary Policy Event-Study Database](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/annex/Dataset_EA-MPD.xlsx) and rotated to provide information about different channels of conventional and unconventional monetary policy. A detailed discussion of the factors rotation and the identification strategy is in the appendix of [(ABGMR){{< ai open-access >}}](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoneco.2019.08.016).

The factors are in two distinct `csv` files:

- `press_release_factors_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`

- `press_conference_factors_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`

The suffix `YYYY-MM-DD` in the filename denotes the last GC's surprises used in the factor extraction.

#### Notes

1. The factors used by [ABMGR](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoneco.2019.08.016) are:

    - [press\_release\_factors\_2018-09-13.csv](data/press_release_factors_2018-09-13.csv)
    - [press\_conference\_factors\_2018-09-13.csv](data/press_conference_factors_2018-09-13.csv)

    There is a difference between the factors used in [ABMGR](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoneco.2019.08.016) and the one you can download from this page. The difference is due to a data revision. The 1-month surprise for the Governing Council of September 4, 2014, has been revised to reflect a stale quote. This revision appeared first in the EA-MDP of January 2022.

2. The factors are normalized as in [ABMGR](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoneco.2019.08.016). More specifically, the `target` and the `timing` factors are normalized to have _unit effect_ on the 1-month and 6-month OIS surprises, respectively; the `fg`  and `qe`  factors are normalized to have a unit effect on the 2-year and the 10-year yields, respectively.
