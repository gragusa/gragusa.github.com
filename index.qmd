:::{#gr-presentation}
{{< fa building-columns >}} I am an Associate Professor of Economics at the [Department of Economics and Law](https://web.uniroma1.it/dip_ecodir/en) at [Sapienza the University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/).

I am also a guest lecturer at the [London Business School](https://www.london.edu).

Before joining the Sapienza University of Rome, I held tenure-track positions at Rutgers University, the University of California, Irvine, Luiss University, and the University of Pisa. 

From 2015 to 2017, I was a Senior Economist at the Monetary Strategy Division of the  European Central Bank. 

{{< fa graduation-cap >}} I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of California, San Diego. My undergraduate education is from Bocconi University. 

{{< fa book-open-reader >}} My most recent research interests include: time series, economic forecasting, approximate bayesian inference, and machine learning applications to economics and finance.

{{< fa person-chalkboard >}} I teach undergraduate and graduate Econometrics, Time Series, and Machine Learning courses. These courses use Julia, R, and Python as software.
