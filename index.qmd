{{< fa building-columns >}} I am a Professor of Econometrics at the [Department of Economics and Law](https://web.uniroma1.it/dip_ecodir/en) at [Sapienza the University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/).

I am the coordinator of the [Ph.D. in Economics](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/ECONOMICS_nD3495_EN.aspx) at [Sapienza the University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/).

I am also an affiliate lecturer at the [London Business School](https://www.london.edu).

Before joining the [Sapienza the University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/), I held tenure-track positions at [Rutgers University](https://economics.rutgers.edu/), the [University of California, Irvine](https://www.economics.uci.edu), Luiss University, and the University of Pisa.

From 2015 to 2017, I was a Senior Economist at the Monetary Strategy Division of the  European Central Bank.

{{< fa graduation-cap >}} I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the [University of California, San Diego](https://economics.ucsd.edu). My undergraduate education is from Bocconi University.

{{< fa book-open-reader >}} My most recent research interests include: time series, economic forecasting, approximate bayesian inference, and machine learning applications to economics and finance.

{{< fa person-chalkboard >}} I teach undergraduate and graduate Econometrics, Time Series, and Machine Learning courses. These courses use Julia, R, and Python as software.
