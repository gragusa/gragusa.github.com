DOI:10.1007/s10614-021-10170-1\n\n[+]\n\n\n\n\nWe focus on forecasting the probability that euro-area inflation will fall into one of three intervals by employing an ordered multinomial model augmented with macroeconomic variables. We directly forecast the probability that the expected euro area HICP price index inflation rate (12-month percent changes) over the next 12 and 24 months will be less than 1.5 percent, exceed 2 percent, or be between these two values. The model includes many predictors, and deal with dimensionality issues by an approach which mixes factor models with Bayesian shrinkage. Our results show that macroeconomic variables’ inclusion improves the model’s forecast quality, especially at the longer horizon considered. The Deflationary Pressure Index coincides with the probability that inflation is below 1.5 percent on average in the next 24 months, and it is useful as a policy monitoring tool.\n\n\n\n\nPaper\n\n\nPreprint\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR.

A byproduct is the publicly available Euro Area Monetary Policy Event-Study Database (EA-MPD), containing intraday asset price changes. We find that Policy Target, Forward Guidance and Quantitative Easing factors capture about all the variation in the yield curve, with different factors appearing in the windows covering the policy decision announcement and the press conference, and having time-varying variance shares. We study sovereign yields, exchange rates, stock prices, persistence of effects and response asymmetry.

DOI:10.1017/dem.2017.22\n\n[+]\n\n\n\n\nCatholic countries of Europe pose a demographic puzzle -fertility is unprecedentedly low (total fertility=1.3) despite low female labor force participation. We model three channels of religious effects on demand for children: through changing norms, reduced market wages, and reduced costs of childrearing. We estimate their effects using new panel data on church attendance and clergy employment for thirteen European countries from 1960-2000, spanning the Second Vatican Council (1962-65). Catholic theology is uniform across countries. Yet service varied considerably across countries and over time, especially before the Council, reflecting differences in Church provision of education, health, welfare and other social services. We use differential declines in service provision --measured by nuns/capita-- to identify its effect on fertility, controlling for secular trends. They are large: 300 to 400 children per nun. Reduced religiosity (measured by church attendance) has no effect for Protestants, but predicts fertility decline for Catholics. The data suggest that service provision and religiosity complement each other -a finding consistent with preferential provision of services to church attendees.

On the other hand, survey expectations can accurately predict yields, but they are typically not available for all maturities and/or forecast horizons. We show how survey expectations can be exploited to improve the accuracy of yield curve forecasts given by a base model. We do so by employing a flexible exponential tilting method that anchors the model forecasts to the survey expectations, and we develop a test to guide the choice of the anchoring points. The method implicitly incorporates into yield curve forecasts any information that survey participants have access to - such as information about the current state of the economy or forward-looking information contained in monetary policy announcements - without the need to explicitly model it. We document that anchoring delivers large and significant gains in forecast accuracy relative to the class of models that are widely adopted by financial and policy institutions for forecasting the term structure of interest rates.\n\n\n\n\nPaper\n\n\nPreprint\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN.

If skilled workers, with their high opportunity cost of time, demand more of these time-intensive services, then wage gains at the top of the wage distribution (such as those observed in the last three decades) are expected to raise the consumption of these services, consistent with these stylized facts.

DOI:10.1111/trf.12458\n\n[+]\n\n\n\n\nBackground: Rapid identification of eligible cord blood units (CBUs) for banking is an important issue in hematopoietic stem cell procurement. Distinct contents of CD34+ cells in CBU can contribute to identify grafts that may be banked also for unrelated transplants or limited to family-directed or autologous use.\nStudy design and methods: Considering thresholds of CD34+ cell content of 3 × 10(6) , 2 × 10(6) , and 1 × 10(6) CD34+ cells, we analyzed a consecutive series of 1309 CBUs. CBUs were collected for autologous banking without any volume-based preselection criteria. Predictors of distinct content of CD34+ cells have been assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.\nResults: Median total nucleated cell (TNC) and CD34+ cell counts of the series were 6.97 × 10(8) (range, 0.36 × 10(8) -34.9 × 10(8) ) and 1.47 × 10(6) (0-20.56 × 10(6) ). Volumes ranged from 21 to 163 mL, with a median of 73.8 mL. For the CD34+ target of 1 × 10(6) , the best predictor was TNC count with a threshold of 6.63 × 10(8) ; volume results were less predictive with a value of 68.1 mL. For CD34+ targets of 2 × 10(6) and 3 × 10(6) , ROC curves confirmed a stronger predictive power of TNC, above the collected volume, with thresholds of 7.55 × 10(8) and 8.98 × 10(8) . ROC analysis by combining all predictors (TNC, volume, TNC(2) , volume(2) , age of mothers, types of delivery, birthweight) gave worse results than TNC count alone.\nConclusions: This analysis, carried out on a large, unrestricted CBU series, shows that TNC alone is the best predictor of distinct targets of hematopoietic potential with the chance to predict CBU potentially useful for unrelated recipients or limited for family-directed or autologous use.\n\n\n\n\nPaper\n\n\nPreprint\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG.

We directly forecast the probability that the expected euro area HICP price index inflation rate (12-month percent changes) over the next 12 and 24 months will be less than 1.5 percent, exceed 2 percent, or be between these two values. The model includes many predictors, and deal with dimensionality issues by an approach which mixes factor models with Bayesian shrinkage. Our results show that macroeconomic variables’ inclusion improves the model’s forecast quality, especially at the longer horizon considered. The Deflationary Pressure Index coincides with the probability that inflation is below 1.5 percent on average in the next 24 months, and it is useful as a policy monitoring tool.\n\n\n\n\nPaper\n\n\nPreprint\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR.

We model three channels of religious effects on demand for children: through changing norms, reduced market wages, and reduced costs of childrearing. We estimate their effects using new panel data on church attendance and clergy employment for thirteen European countries from 1960-2000, spanning the Second Vatican Council (1962-65). Catholic theology is uniform across countries. Yet service varied considerably across countries and over time, especially before the Council, reflecting differences in Church provision of education, health, welfare and other social services. We use differential declines in service provision --measured by nuns/capita-- to identify its effect on fertility, controlling for secular trends. They are large: 300 to 400 children per nun. Reduced religiosity (measured by church attendance) has no effect for Protestants, but predicts fertility decline for Catholics. The data suggest that service provision and religiosity complement each other -a finding consistent with preferential provision of services to church attendees.

Further, we study the determinants of routinization, using the EU-SILC data, and find that young individuals are more likely to hold routine jobs, as are workers with lower education or those employed in temporary jobs. This evidence applies for overall Europe as well as for different groups of countries. Finally, routinization represents a driver of unemployment inflows: individuals in routine jobs display, ceteris paribus, a higher probability to become unemployed: a one standard deviation increase in the RTI index entails a 10{\\%} increase of getting into unemployment.\n\n\n\n\nPreprint\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE.

Recent papers have found job polarization patterns also in Europe, while few evidence is available for wages. The goal of the paper is to investigate the dynamics of unconditional and conditional—on technology—wages in Europe, using industry (EU KLEMS) data. As for unconditional wages, there are no wage polarization trends at work, as the wage structure is broadly constant over time. For the conditional polarization, we investigate the impact of ICT intensity on wages and hours worked by three skill groups by education levels. Our analysis does not provide evidence supporting the conditional polarization of wages, while we detect job polarization trends.\n\n\n\n\nPreprint\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG.

Massari (2014): \nUnconditional and Conditional Wage Polarization in Europe, Discussion Paper Series, Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit (IZA), No. 8465, .\n\n[+]\n\n\n\n\nThis paper investigates the dynamics of the distribution of unconditional and conditional -on technology—wages in Europe, using both industry and individual level data for the period 1995-2007. We find that the unconditional wage distribution shows scant signs of polariza- tion in Europe. On the other hand, the effect of technology is more nuanced. At the industry level, technological changes have an effect on polarization of jobs, but not on polarization of wages. At the individual level, we use a counterfactual distributional analysis which accounts for the heterogeneity of tasks across occupations, and we find only mild evidence of wage polarization. Technology affects the lower and upper part of the wage distribution in different ways, with service tasks affecting the lower quantiles and abstract tasks affecting the higher ones.\n\n\n\n\nPreprint\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR.

The effects of time limits depend on the stock of remaining months of eligibility, which in turn depends on the state time limit and on family’s welfare use since the policy was implemented. Since the latter is potentially endogenous to current outcomes, we form a prediction of remaining eligibility based on state rules and observable family characteristics. For families who are predicted to have hit the limit, we find evidence of enforcement of the policy, which causes monthly income from welfare to drop by an average of \\$250. This loss is not offset by increases in other income sources: not only there is no significant change in earnings (despite a sizable increase in the likelihood that the mother works), but also income from other transfer programs (such as SSI and Food Stamps) decreases – resulting in increasing rates of deep poverty among these families. Additional analyses suggest that doubling up is a way for families who timed out of welfare to share housekeeping expenses.\n\n\n\n\nPreprint\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG.

For these models, a posterior distribution cannot be calculated because the likelihood function has not been fully specified. In this paper, we obtain a class of likelihoods by formal Bayesian calculations that take into account the semiparametric nature of the problem. The likelihoods are derived by integrating out the nuisance parameters with respect to a maximum entropy tilted prior on the space of distribution. The result is a unification that uncovers a mapping between priors and likelihood functions. We show that there exist priors such that the likelihoods are closely connected to Generalized Empirical Likelihood (GEL) methods.\n\n\n\n\nPreprint\n\n\nCode"
