Econometric Review Course is a 20 hours long course. I am teaching half of the
course; the other half is taught by Marco Lippi.

In my part I will focus on the specification and estimation of the linear
regression model. The course departs from the standard Gauss-Markov assumptions
to include heteroskedasticity, serial correlation, and errors in variables.
Advanced topics include generalized least squares, instrumental variables,
generalized method of moments, limited dependent variable models, and panel
data.
