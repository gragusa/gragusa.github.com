      <description>There will be a weekly problem set. The assignments will involve both theoretical and empirical work. Group study and free discussion are encouraged. But you should submit your own answers. You will probably find the class very hard to follow if you fail to spend sufficient time on all of the problem sets. The problem sets are part of the final grade as explained in the next section below.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of &lt;strong&gt;Applied Statistics and Econometrics&lt;/strong&gt; is to provide an introduction to the practice of econometrics. While both theoretical and practical aspects are covered, emphasis will be on intuitive understanding and concepts will be illustrated with real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The software used in this course is R. No prior knowledge of this software package is assumed. This package will be introduced in the TA Sessions.
R is installed on all computers in the computer lab. Since R is open source you can freely install it on your laptop or desktop. R is available for all major computing platforms: Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux. Platform specific installation help can be found at here.</description>

      <description>The TAs will lead a weekly practice session which will be held in the computer labs (301 and 306).
The TA sessions are an important part of the course and regular and attendance is strongly encouraged. During these sessions, the TA will review the concepts introduced in class and solve applied problems using R.
The sessions are also the right place to ask questions about the problem set of the week.</description>
